	<h3>LOPEZ ORDERS CLOSURE OF 23 METALLIC MINES</a></h3>
	<p>Environment Secretary Gina Lopez on Thursday ordered the closure of 23 metallic 
	mines in the country, while suspending five more, for serious environmental violations discovered 
	during the industry-wide audit conducted by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) since July last year.
	“My issue here is not about mining. My issue here is social justice. If there are businesses 
	and foreigners that go and utilize the resources of that area for their benefit and the people 
	of the island suffer, that’s social injustice,” 
	Lopez said during a press conference held at the DENR OSEC Conference Room in Quezon City.

	<h3>Waste-to-energy technologies in PH? 'Go zero waste instead'</a></h3>
	<p>	MANILA, Philippines – It was in his first State of the Nation Address when President Rodrigo 
	Duterte first revealed his plan to explore the adoption of appropriate waste-to-energy facilities in the country.

	Following his speech, different environment groups quickly 
	called on the President to reconsider this plan since "incinerators 
	masquerading as [waste-to-energy] are false and expensive solutions to the garbage problem."

	<p>MIAMI, USA – Last year, the Earth sweltered under the hottest temperatures in modern times for the third year 
	in a row, US scientists said Wednesday, January 18, raising new concerns about the quickening pace of climate change.

	<h3>E-waste rising dangerously in Asia – UN study</a></h3>
	<p>MANILA, Philippines – Electronic waste is rising sharply across Asia as higher incomes 
	allow hundreds of millions of people to buy smartphones and other gadgets, 
	with serious consequences for human health and the environment, according to a UN study released Sunday, January 15.

	So-called e-waste in Asia has jumped 63% in 5 years, the report by the United 
	Nations University said, as it warned of a need for most nations across the region to improve recycling and disposal methods.

	<h3>Keep public parks trash-free during the holidays</a></h3>
	<p>Trash can become a breeding ground for disease-causing bacteria, insects, and pests, 
	including mosquitoes that carry chikungunya, dengue, and Zika. Children 
	can be injured if they accidentally step on broken glass or bamboo skewers left scattered.

	Littering is an offense under Republic Act 9003, or the Ecological Solid Waste Management 
	Act, Tolentino pointed out. Violators can be fined from P300 to P1,000, asked to render 
	community service, or be required to pay a fine as well as perform community service.
