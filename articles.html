	<p>Environment Secretary Gina Lopez on Thursday ordered the closure of 23 metallic 
	mines in the country, while suspending five more, for serious environmental violations discovered 
	during the industry-wide audit conducted by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) since July last year.
	“My issue here is not about mining. My issue here is social justice. If there are businesses 
	and foreigners that go and utilize the resources of that area for their benefit and the people 
	of the island suffer, that’s social injustice,” 
	Lopez said during a press conference held at the DENR OSEC Conference Room in Quezon City.

	<p>Philippines is considered to be 5th mineralized country in the world, the 3rd country in terms of 
	gold reserves, 4th in copper and 5th in nickel. Total value of resources could reach around $840 billion 
	to $1 trillion. These reserves could be used to support national industrialization and 
	agricultural modernization if properly regulated and developed (CEC Phils, 2012).

	<p>	MANILA, Philippines – It was in his first State of the Nation Address when President Rodrigo 
	Duterte first revealed his plan to explore the adoption of appropriate waste-to-energy facilities in the country.

	Following his speech, different environment groups quickly 
	called on the President to reconsider this plan since "incinerators 
	masquerading as [waste-to-energy] are false and expensive solutions to the garbage problem."

	<p>PUERTO PRINCESA, Philippines – Palawan Governor Jose Alvarez has urged reef-fish-for-food 
	(RFF) stakeholders to join the law enforcement authorities in their continuing 
	crackdown on illegal fishing that destroys coral reefs and imperils the sustainability of their industry.

	Alvarez made the call on Tuesday, January 17, during the implementation review on the 
	Palawan Council for Sustainable Development Administrative Order No. 5 (PCSD AO 5) or 
	the policy regulating the province’s lucrative yet threatened RFF industry. RFF traders, 
	catchers, and other stakeholders attended the event.

	<p>MIAMI, USA – Last year, the Earth sweltered under the hottest temperatures in modern times for the third year 
	in a row, US scientists said Wednesday, January 18, raising new concerns about the quickening pace of climate change.
	Temperatures spiked to new national highs in parts of India, Kuwait and Iran, while sea 
	ice melted faster than ever in the fragile Arctic, said the report by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

	<p>MANILA, Philippines – Electronic waste is rising sharply across Asia as higher incomes 
	allow hundreds of millions of people to buy smartphones and other gadgets, 
	with serious consequences for human health and the environment, according to a UN study released Sunday, January 15.

	So-called e-waste in Asia has jumped 63% in 5 years, the report by the United 
	Nations University said, as it warned of a need for most nations across the region to improve recycling and disposal methods.

	<p>Trash can become a breeding ground for disease-causing bacteria, insects, and pests, 
	including mosquitoes that carry chikungunya, dengue, and Zika. Children 
	can be injured if they accidentally step on broken glass or bamboo skewers left scattered.

	Littering is an offense under Republic Act 9003, or the Ecological Solid Waste Management 
	Act, Tolentino pointed out. Violators can be fined from P300 to P1,000, asked to render 
	community service, or be required to pay a fine as well as perform community service.
