		<p id = "deforestationparam1">The looting of Borneo didn’t start with palm oil, and it doesn’t end there either. Humans have had a long 
			and complicated history with the island. Chinese traders traveled to Borneo for rhinocerous horn as well as timber,
			National Geographic reports. Muslim and Portuguese traders were interested in the island’s pepper and gold. 
			In the 19th and 20th centuries, loggers began to flood Borneo. Europe, the United States and Australia have been drilling for 
			oil and natural gases in Borneo for decades. Coal minining is also currently a threat, as it pollutes local rivers.

					<p id = "deforestationparam2">In the 1950s, two alien machines were introduced to the forests of Borneo, 
						changing the island forever: the chainsaw and the caterpillar tractor. Since then, 
						illegal logging has become all too familiar for those in Borneo, causing devastating
						damage to one of the most biologically diverse habitats on Earth.
						According to the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), between 1985 and 2001, illegal 
						logging decimated 56 percent of lowland tropical rainforest in the Indonesian territory
						of Kalimantan. That equates to more than 18,000 square miles of rainforest.
