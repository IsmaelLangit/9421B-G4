				<p id ="whydoineed1param">We believe that joining <strong id ="towardsgreenstrong">TowardsGreen.org </strong>is just one of the thousand ways to preserve and save our Environment. This is not only an advocacy but also a great responsibility, think of this, how would you feel if the last tree is starting to fall while you are reading this, or let say, "trees", "nature" or any word that is related to Environment is just taught in school and your children just see it on pictures, not on pointing these things personally by you as a parent, and teaching it when he was growing up. These internalizations are the fuel that boosts our passion to build an organization like this. Everyone should have a part, or cooperate, and if you think TowardsGreen.org is your way, <strong id ="joinnowstrong">JOIN US NOW</strong>.</p>
