		<h2>Environmental Protection</h2>
		<p>Rules that aims to conserve the natural resources and preserving the beauty of nature, whereas avoiding the extinction of these resources. Because of our bad attitude towards the environment, it has been abused and therefore havingnegative effects like greenhouse effect, water pollution, air pollution, landslide, acid rain etc. The government then noticed the negative effects and begun to make caution on activities that causes the environmental detrioration.</p>


		<h2>Why do I need to join?</h2>
		<p>We believe&nbsp; that joining <strong>TowardsGreen.org </strong>is just one of the thousand ways to preserve and save our Environment. This is not only an advocacy but also a great responsibily, think of this, how would you feel if the last tree is starting to fall while you are reading this, or let say, "trees", "nature" or any word that is related to Environment is just taught in school and your children just see it on pictures, not on pointing these things personally by you as a parent, and teaching it when he was growing up. These internalizations are the fuel that boost our passion to to build an organization like this. Everyone should have a part, or cooperate, and if you think TowardsGreen.org is your way, <strong>JOIN US NOW</strong>.</p>
