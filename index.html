		<h2>TowardsGreen.org</h2>
		<p><strong>TowardsGreen.org</strong> is a private non-profit organization. It only started with five people who had a great vision and passion to create an<strong> Environmental Protection Advocacy</strong> in<strong> Baguio City, Philippines</strong>.</p>

		<h2>Vision</h2>
		<p>We vision that<strong> every child in the next generation</strong> will feel the fresh air,&nbsp; run through green grass, and witness a <strong>world towards green</strong>.</p>\

		<h2>Why do I need to join?</h2>
		<p>We believe&nbsp; that joining <strong>TowardsGreen.org </strong>is just one of the thousand ways to preserve and save our Environment. This is not only an advocacy but also a great responsibily, think of this, how would you feel if the last tree is starting to fall while you are reading this, or let say, "trees", "nature" or any word that is related to Environment is just taught in school and your children just see it on pictures, not on pointing these things personally by you as a parent, and teaching it when he was growing up. These internalizations are the fuel that boost our passion to to build an organization like this. Everyone should have a part, or cooperate, and if you think TowardsGreen.org is your way, <strong>JOIN US NOW</strong>.</p>
