	<p id = "pollutionparam1">Pollution is a common term that people used to indicate that it has contaminants into the natural environment that caused the adverse change.</p>
	<p id = "pollutionparam2">Pollution of air, water and soil require millions of years to recoup. 
	Industry and motor vehicle exhaust are the number one pollutants. Heavy metals, nitrates and plastic are toxins responsible for pollution. While water pollution is caused by oil spill, acid rain, urban runoff; air pollution is caused by various gases and toxins released by industries and factories and combustion of fossil fuels; soil pollution is majorly caused by industrial waste that deprives soil from essential nutrients.</p>

	NPR is reporting that the UNICEF document is based, in large part, on data gathered via satellite imagery to find out which parts of the globe were most heavily impacted by polluted air.

	<p id = "pollutionwater3">Although natural phenomena such as volcanoes, storms, earthquakes etc. also cause major changes in water quality and the ecological status of water, these are not deemed to be pollution.
	Water pollution has many causes and characteristics.
	Increases in nutrient loading may lead to eutrophication.
	Organic wastes such as sewage and farm waste impose high oxygen demands on the receiving water leading to oxygen depletion with potentially severe impacts on the whole eco-system.

		<p id = "pollutionwatercauses1">Here are some of the causes of water pollution:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong id ="sewagestrong">Sewage</strong> - is a completely natural substance that should be broken down harmlessly in the environment. However, sewage disposal affects people's environments that leads to water-related diseases. 
			It is beause sewage water contains all kinds of harmful chemicals that were either washed down the toilets, sinks, or even drainage.</li>
			<li><strong id ="nutrientstrong">Nutrients</strong> - also known as "Chemical Fertilizers". It is offend used by farmers on adding nutrients to the soil. It is also called as a "Harmful Algal Bloom" or red tide because it can make the water turn to red. It is one of the harmful chemical that removes oxygen from waters which can kill other forms of living organisms which leads to <strong>DEAD ZONE</strong></li>
			<li><strong id ="wastewaterstrong">Waste water</strong> - Chemicals that were washed down the drains or were discharged from factories. Water may be also polluted by ordinary people like dumping of trashes into the river. These are some other things that makes the water become a waste because these goes directly to the ocean or rivers. A lot of toxic chemicals that are washed up to the rivers can kill a large amount of fishes which decreases our resources for food. </li>
			<li><strong id ="oilpollutionstrong">Oil pollution</strong> - Some part of the ocean there are huge black oil slicks. This is only a fraction of all the pollution that enter our oceans. This is often comes from tanker accidents where a ship delivering oil spills on the oceans or that was poured down the drains by people in the land. This cases can kill huge amount of marine animals and also to land animals.</li>
			<li><strong id ="plasticsstrong">Plastics</strong> - Plastics are not that toxic but it is made with hazardous chemicals. Plastics that are thrown to the sea can harm marine animals and even sea birds. They can die from choking because they thought the plastic were food. Plastics also take time to decompose which is very hard to get rid of them.</li>

		<p id = "pollutionwater4">When people rely on a specific body of water for drinking, cleaning and other purposes and that water becomes polluted it can become a  major issue. Once water becomes polluted it becomes unsafe for consumption due to the dangerous or toxic materials that are contained within the water.If contaminated water is consumed it could lead to sickness, infections, exposure to diseases and even death. While pollution is a growing concern determining what water is polluted isn’t always easy when observed by the naked eye or our taste buds.

		<h2 id = "pollutionairsolutions"> What I can do </h2>
		<p id = "pollutionairways">Here are some possible things to do to prevent even more contributions in polluting the air:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Encourage your family to use the bus, train or bike when commuting and with it fewer fumes will be produced.</li>
			<li>Use energy (light, water, boiler, kettle and fire woods) wisely. This is because lots of fossil fuels are burned to generate electricity, and so if we can cut down the use, we will also cut down the amount of pollution we create.</li>
			<li>Recycle and re-use things. This will minimize the dependence of producing new things. Manufacturing industries create a lot of pollution, so by  re-using things like shopping plastic bags, clothing, paper and bottles, it can help.</li>
			<li>Turn off lights when not in use. The more you waste energy the more we are polluting the air.</li>
			<li>Avoid using plastic bags and burning them. Plastic bags are made of oil products and could take time burning them or even decompose.</li>
			<li>Quit smoking. Smoking changes the quality of air that is around you and can be very harmful to our health as well.</li>
