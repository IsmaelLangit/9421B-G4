<h1>What is Pollution?</h1>
<p>Pollution is a common term that people used to indicate that it has contaminants into the natural environment that caused the adverse change.
</br>
Pollution of air, water and soil require millions of years to recoup. 
Industry and motor vehicle exhaust are the number one pollutants. Heavy metals, nitrates and plastic are toxins responsible for pollution. While water pollution is caused by oil spill, acid rain, urban runoff; air pollution is caused by various gases and toxins released by industries and factories and combustion of fossil fuels; soil pollution is majorly caused by industrial waste that deprives soil from essential nutrients.</p>
</div>

<div class = "content-top land">

<h1> Types of Pollution </h1>
<h2> 1. Land Pollution</h2>

<p> It is a destruction of our land. It is the result of our "unhuman" activities that leads to the destruction of our Earth's land. It sometimes occurs naturally like volcanic eruptions, hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods but mostly it is not.</p>

	<h2> Causes </h2>
	<p>Here are some causes of land-pollution</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Deforestation and soil erosion</strong> - <a href="deforestation.html">Deforestation</a> is carried out to create dry lands. Because of this land can't be fertile again.  </li>
			<li><strong>Agricultural activities</strong> - Due to growing human population, the demands for our resources grows larger which means demand for food increased. Because of that farmers uses large amount of land and uses highly toxicated fertilizers and pesticides to get rid of bacterias but too much of this could actually contaminate the soil that can create contaminated food that people will be consuming.</li>
			<li><strong>Mining activities</strong> - Several mining activities are created beneath the surface which could lead to danger. Which makes it risky and people could be "locked in" because it's the nature's way to fill spaces left out by miners.</li>

	<h2> What I can do </h2>
	<p>There are a lot of ways to prevent further complications that land pollution could do to our beloved environment. Here are some ways to prevent it:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Make people aware about the concept of Reduce, Recycle and Reuse</strong> - this can be used to minimize the amount of waste that we have been giving to our environment!</li>
			<li>Ensure that you do not litter on the ground and do proper disposal of garbage.</li>
			<li><strong>Don’t use pesticides</strong> this way you can eat foods that are organic and not those that was sprayed on with pesticides that could contaminate your food.</li>

<h2> 2. Water Pollution</h2>

<p>Clean drinking water is becoming a rare commodity. Water is becoming an economic and political issue as the human population fights for this resource. One of the options suggested is using the process of desalinization. Industrial development is filling our rivers seas and oceans with toxic pollutants which are a major threat to human health.</p>
<p>The chemicals could very quickly have an effect on the quality of the water that could affect the health of all humans, animals, and plants.</p>

	<h2> Causes </h2>
	<p>Here are some of the causes of water pollution:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Sewage</strong> - is a completely natural substance that should be broken down harmlessly in the environment. However, sewage disposal affects people's environments that leads to water-related diseases. 
		It is beause sewage water contains all kinds of harmful chemicals that were either washed down the toilets, sinks, or even drainage.</li>
		<li><strong>Nutrients</strong> - also known as "Chemical Fertilizers". It is offend used by farmers on adding nutrients to the soil. It is also called as a "Harmful Algal Bloom" or red tide because it can make the water turn to red. It is one of the harmful chemical that removes oxygen from waters which can kill other forms of living organisms which leads to <strong>DEAD ZONE</strong></li>
		<li><strong>Waste water</strong> - Chemicals that were washed down the drains or were discharged from factories. Water may be also polluted by ordinary people like dumping of trashes into the river. These are some other things that makes the water become a waste because these goes directly to the ocean or rivers. A lot of toxic chemicals that are washed up to the rivers can kill a large amount of fishes which decreases our resources for food. </li>
		<li><strong>Oil pollution</strong> - Some part of the ocean there are huge black oil slicks. This is only a fraction of all the pollution that enter our oceans. This is often comes from tanker accidents where a ship delivering oil spills on the oceans or that was poured down the drains by people in the land. This cases can kill huge amount of marine animals and also to land animals.</li>
		<li><strong>Plastics</strong> - Plastics are not that toxic but it is made with hazardous chemicals. Plastics that are thrown to the sea can harm marine animals and even sea birds. They can die from choking because they thought the plastic were food. Plastics also take time to decompose which is very hard to get rid of them.</li>

	<h2> What I can do </h2>
	<p>Here are some ways to prevent water pollutions:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Never dispose chemicals and oils down sinks, toilets or drainage.</li>
		<li>Do not throw tissues, wrappers, dust cloths or other products down the toilets! It's not a garbage bin.</li>

<div class = "content-top air">

<h2> 3. Air Pollution</h2>

<p> It occurs when gases, dust particles, fume or smokes or odor are introduced into the atmosphere in a way that makes it harmful for humans, animals, and even plants. 
This is also because the air becomes contaminated.</p>
</div>

<div class = "container air-content">
	<div class = "content left">
	<h2> Causes </h2>
	<p>Here are some causes of air pollution that contribute largely to the environment "contamination"</p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Emissions from industries and manufacturing activities</strong> - waste incinerators, manufacturing industries and power plants emit high levels of carbon monoxide, organic compounds, and chemicals into the air that was erected through the chimneys of the factories.</li>
			<li><strong>Burning Fossil Fuels</strong> - humans rely heavily on vehicles and engines for transporting people, good and services thus fumes from car exhausts contain dangerous gases such as carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen, hydrocarbons and particulates.</li>
			<li><strong>Household and Farming Chemicals</strong> - Crop dusting, fumigating homes, household cleaning products or painting supplies, over the counter insect/pest killers, fertilizer dust emit harmful chemicals into the air and cause pollution.</li>

	<h2> What I can do </h2>
	<p>Here are some possible things to do to prevent even more contributions in polluting the air:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Encourage your family to use the bus, train or bike when commuting and with it fewer fumes will be produced.</li>
			<li>Use energy (light, water, boiler, kettle and fire woods) wisely. This is because lots of fossil fuels are burned to generate electricity, and so if we can cut down the use, we will also cut down the amount of pollution we create.</li>
			<li>Recycle and re-use things. This will minimize the dependence of producing new things. Manufacturing industries create a lot of pollution, so by  re-using things like shopping plastic bags, clothing, paper and bottles, it can help.</li>
			<li>Turn off lights when not in use. The more you waste energy the more we are polluting the air.</li>
			<li>Avoid using plastic bags and burning them. Plastic bags are made of oil products and could take time burning them or even decompose.</li>
			<li>Quit smoking. Smoking changes the quality of air that is around you and can be very harmful to our health as well.</li>
