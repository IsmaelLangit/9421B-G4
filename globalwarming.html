<h1>What is Global Warming</h1>
<p>
It is the number one problem of the Earth since it is the increase of Earth's temperature due to the greenhouse gases that is polluting the air such as carbon dioxide that the fossil fuels produce.

	<p>No matter where in the world we live - we all are affected by global warming in some way or another.
	Global warming effects are many, and they are different depending on which part of the planet you belong to.

	<h2> Causes </h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Deforestation - using the forests as fuel, wherein this deforestation releases large amount of carbon. </li>
		<li>Excessive usage of chemicals for the croplands. </li>
		<li>The emission of Carbon from power plants of fossil fuel.</li>
		<li>The emission of carbon dioxide from gasoline for transportation.</li>
		<li>Methane emissions from animals.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Thanks to growing marine dead zones that are caused by global warming, there's been a huge spike in dead sea life in recent years--
	and it often washes up on shore, providing us with an unsubtle reminder.

		<h2>Stop Deforestation</h2>
		<h3>Credit: ucsusa.org</h3>
		<p>Reducing tropical deforestation can significantly lower global warming emissions and — together with efforts to reduce emissions 
		from fossil fuels — plays an integral role in a comprehensive long-term solution to global warming.
